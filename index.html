    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>My goal is to create exciting projects from the ground up that integrate web development, software, and the power and functionality of Artificial Intelligence</p>
    
    <h2>Education:</h2>
    <p>Like many people I have been taught through schooling and life. The schooling teaches skills that are essential for advancing your career. Whereas life teaches
        you things that are essential to being a better person. That being said, here are my Educational experiences:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Univeristy of Lethbridge</b>: Bachelors, with Distinction, in Computer Science
                <ul> 
                    <li> Minor in Mathematics and Religion </li>
                    <li>Final GPA: 3.5/4</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    &nbsp;

    <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Elite Automation and Technical Services:</b> May 2023 - August 2023 | January 2024 - March 2024
            <p>I was given the opportunity to work in my home town with a group of intelligent and resourceful individuals. I was able to learn about Automation, 
                life, and people if even only for a short while. I was responsible for the development of a project they'd hoped would grow, but unfortunately due to
                a lack of support and experience it was short lived. I am happy to report that I was able to finish the prototype of the product! There is a 
                demo of the project on my Github and Linkedin! ~ Cam
            </p>
            <ul>

                    Role: Computer Technician
                    <p>Skills and Insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inquisitive and receptive to learn from anyone and everyone around me simply to absorb as much as possible</li>
                        <li>Creative and determined to create the best project I am capable of with the best practices at my disposal</li>
                        <li>Adaptive and respectful to learn and apply as the project unfolds and takes shape</li>
                    </ul>

        <li><b>University of Lethbridge:</b> January 2023 - June 2023
            <p>I was graciously accepted to work at the University of Lethbridge as a Research Assistant with the Quantum Optimization team! Unfortunately this too was short
                lived. During that summer there were wildfires near my home and due to evacuations and lack of time and space I had to pick between continuing work with Elite or
                the research. Not an ideal choice but you hit what's pitched! ~ Cam
