    <h1>The Things that I find enjoyable!</h1>
    <p>I have many things I find interesting but generally stick to the things that make me feel excited!
        Those generally are:

        <ul>
            <li>General Fitness: I am in the gym most everyday! </li>
            <li>Philosophy: You can never know enough! </li>
            <li>Photography: I am not very good! But it excites me!</li>
            <li>Artifical Intelligence: This has so many uses for so many of the things I find exciting!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
